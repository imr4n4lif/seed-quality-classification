# Seed Quality Classification

This project focuses on classifying seed quality using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The dataset contains seed images that are processed and trained using multiple state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to compare performance, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
A machine learning project to classify seeds into **Good** or **Bad** based on images.  
**Dataset:** Currently being collected and curated manually.

## Project Goals
- Create a clean and dataset of good vs bad seeds.
- Train and compare multiple image classification models.
- Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and overall performance.
