# Seed Classification

This project focuses on **seed type classification** using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify the **type of seed** from an image.

The dataset is **manually collected** and consists of images of real seeds belonging to specific vegetable categories.

## Seed Classes

The dataset includes the following seed classes:

* Bitter Melon
* Bottle Gourd
* Carrot
* Cauliflower
* Chili
* Coriander Leaves
* Cucumber
* Hyacinth Bean
* Malabar Spinach
* Onion
* Radish
* Spinach
* Tomato
* Water Spinach

## Project Objectives

* Create a manually collected dataset of different vegetable seeds.
* Train deep learning models to classify seed **types** from images.
* Compare model performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
